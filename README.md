# Spotify Jukebox
Spotify Jukebox is an application allowing you to play music from Spotify collaboratively.

This application needs one Spotify account to function, and the current active device of this account will be used to play music.

The application needs to run on a local network, and users connected to the network can join the app by visiting `http://<host-ip-adress>:<application-port>` in their web browser.

## Setup
### Spotify for Developers account
The application uses the Spotify APIs, which requires a Spotify for Developers application.
* If you have a Spotify account, you can create a Spotify for Developpers account by visiting https://developer.spotify.com
* Then go to your Spotify for Developers Dahboard, and create an app
* In the settings, you will find your `Client ID` and `Client secret`, which will be needed when starting the app
* Go to you app settings, and in the "Redirect URIs" section add the following URI : `http://<your-host-ip>:<app-port>/api/callback`, where `<your-host-ip>` is the ip adress of the application host on your local network, and `<app-port>` is the port used by the application (default is `3000`)
* In the Users Mangement tab of your Spotify app dashboard, register a user with an email adress corresponding to your Spotify account

## Launching the app
### For production
